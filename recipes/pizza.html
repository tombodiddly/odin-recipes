    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pepperoni Pizza is the truly perfect food. Delicious hot or cold, at home
        or on the go. Is there ever really a bad time for a slice or three?!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound refrigerated pizza dough</li>
        <li>¼ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced pepperoni</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place pizza stone on grill directly over wood fire. You may need to 
            begin by spreading out the wood if the flames are too tall. Roll out 
            the pizza dough to desired thickness. Place it on the pizza stone and 
            cook 10 minutes on one side until golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from the fire and on the cooked side, spread the pizza sauce in 
            an even layer over dough leaving about a half inch around the rim of 
            the pizza dough bare. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top of the 
            sauce, followed by the pepperoni slices.</li>
        <li>Place uncooked side down, back on the pizza stone. Cover with a foil 
            tent and cook until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes more. Transfer 
            pizza to a cutting board and let cool slightly before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ul>
